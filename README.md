  <h2 align="center">URGENT: Getting BANNED!</h2>

  <p align="center">
    <b>Using these hacks may result in a month-long or permanent ban from Blooket.<br></b>
    IF YOU GET BANNED, IT ISN'T OUR FAULT. Every script that might ban you has been removed.<br>
    <br>
    If you missed this and are currently banned, we can't actually do anything (there is no script).

    I've been seeing MANY people talking about make the Add Tokens add more than 500, can you change the chance of a blook, etc.?<br>
    I wanted to clear up, there are some things you just can't change. I know it's frustrating.<br>
    There are some things you can't change without owning this site or having access to the database.<br>
    Please keep this in mind. Thank you a lot for the support.<br>
    <br>
    The three I've seen most are: change chance of something, more than 500 tokens, and unban account.

Hey hey, I've been seeing MANY discussions talking about make the token hack more than 500, can you change the chance of this and that? I wanted to clear up, the max tokens per day is 500, and it is impossible under no circumstance to change chances as that is actual Blooket code hard coded, I would need access to Blooket's code that get's pushed out to change this.
Thank you alot for the support,
